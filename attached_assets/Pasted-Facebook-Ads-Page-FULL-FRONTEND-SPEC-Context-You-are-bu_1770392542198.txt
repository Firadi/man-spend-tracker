Facebook Ads Page (FULL FRONTEND SPEC)
📌 Context

You are building a React frontend-only page called Facebook Ads inside an existing SaaS-style web app.

This page is NOT connected to Facebook yet.
There is NO backend, NO OAuth, NO API calls at this stage.

However, the page must be 100% API-ready:

Data models must exactly match Facebook Marketing API concepts

UI and logic must NOT need refactoring when backend is added later

All data must persist in localStorage.

🧱 Page Purpose (VERY IMPORTANT)

The Facebook Ads page is a preparation and selection page.

Its only responsibilities are:

Display Facebook Ads structure (Campaign → Ad Set → Ad)

Allow selecting Ad Sets only

Prepare Ad Set selections to be used later in Analyse page

Store selected Ad Sets temporarily (NOT linked to products here)

❌ This page must NOT:

Link products

Calculate spend

Show KPIs

Fetch real Facebook data

🧭 Page Location

Page name: Facebook Ads

Appears in left sidebar navigation

🖥️ UI LAYOUT (DETAILED)
1️⃣ Top Connection Section

A card at the top of the page containing:

Connection Status

Badge:

🔴 Not Connected (default)

🟢 Connected (mock toggle for UI testing)

Button

Text: Connect Facebook Ads

This is a placeholder button

Clicking it only toggles the status (no OAuth logic)

Ad Account Selector

Dropdown

Mock data

At least one option:

act_123456789

Must be designed as if multiple ad accounts can exist

2️⃣ Search & Filters Section

Directly under the connection section:

Search Input

Searches across:

Campaign name

Ad Set name

Ad name

Case-insensitive

Instant filtering

Filters

Dropdowns for:

Campaign (unique campaign names)

Ad Set (unique ad set names)

Status:

All

Active

Paused

Filters must work together.

3️⃣ Main Table (Spreadsheet-like)
Table Columns (EXACT ORDER)

Checkbox (for selection)

Campaign

Ad Set

Ad

Status

Example Rows
☐ | Winter Sales | Broad – Men | Creative 1 | Active
☐ | Winter Sales | Broad – Men | Creative 2 | Active
☐ | Winter Sales | Retargeting | Video 1   | Paused
☐ | Testing      | ABO Test    | Image A   | Active
Status Styling

Active → green label

Paused → red label

🧠 SELECTION LOGIC (CRITICAL)
Selection Unit

Selection is BY AD SET, not by Ad

Ads are display-only

Behavior

If a user selects one row:

All rows with the same adSetId become selected

Unselecting one unselects the whole Ad Set

Selection state must stay consistent across filtered views

📌 Bulk Selection Bar (IMPORTANT UX)

When at least 1 Ad Set is selected:

Show a sticky bottom bar with:

Text: X Ad Sets selected

Button: Clear selection

Button: Save selection

Clear selection

Unselects all Ad Sets

Save selection

Saves selected Ad Sets to localStorage

Does NOT link to products

Only prepares data for Analyse page

🗂️ DATA MODELS (DO NOT CHANGE)
Table Rows (API-READY)
fbAdsTable = [
  {
    campaignId: "cmp_1",
    campaignName: "Winter Sales",
    adSetId: "adset_1",
    adSetName: "Broad – Men",
    adId: "ad_1",
    adName: "Creative 1",
    status: "Active" // or "Paused"
  }
]

❗ Must be flat structure (NO nesting)

Selected Ad Sets (Temporary Storage)
tempSelectedAdSets = [
  {
    adSetId: "adset_1",
    adSetName: "Broad – Men",
    campaignId: "cmp_1",
    campaignName: "Winter Sales"
  }
]

Stored in localStorage

Restored on page reload

Used later by Analyse page

🌱 Seed / Mock Data (MANDATORY)

On first load, populate localStorage with:

At least 2 campaigns

At least 3 ad sets

Multiple ads per ad set

The page must NEVER be empty on first load.

💾 Persistence Rules

fbAdsTable → localStorage

tempSelectedAdSets → localStorage

Selection must persist on refresh

Filters/search must NOT break selection

🎨 UX Rules

Clean, spreadsheet-like UI

Fast interaction (no modals here)

No blocking validations

No error messages related to missing API

Designed for large tables (performance-friendly)

🚫 DO NOT IMPLEMENT

Facebook OAuth

Facebook SDK

Backend calls

Spend fetching

Product linking

Only prepare the frontend structure.

✅ Final Requirement

This Facebook Ads page must be:

Production-quality UI

API-ready

Fully compatible with future backend integration

Usable immediately with mock data
